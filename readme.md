## 🚀 Overview

**CyberLLM** is an advanced autonomous cybersecurity framework. Unlike traditional tools, it uses a **JARVIS Controller** to understand natural language intent, orchestrate specialized AI agents, and learn from every incident.

This system is capable of:
- **Autonomous Threat Hunting**: Scans processes, files, and logs for IOCs.
- **Intelligent Routing**: Understands commands like "Is anyone logged in?" or "Scan for open ports".
- **Self-Healing**: Automatically recovers from execution errors.
- **Continuous Learning**: Remembers past incidents to detect patterns.

## ✨ Key Capabilities

- **🗣️ JARVIS Interface**: Chat naturally with your security system.
- **🤖 Multi-Agent Swarm**:
    - **Coordinator**: Manages the mission.
    - **Hunter**: Scans for threats.
    - **Analyst**: Writes reports and Sigma rules.
- **🧠 Memory Engine**: Stores threat events and learns from them continuously.
- **🛡️ Auto-Recovery**: Detects OS-specific syntax errors (e.g., PowerShell vs Bash) and fixes them on the fly.

## 🚦 Getting Started

### 1. Interactive JARVIS Mode (Recommended)
Speak to the system directly.

```powershell
python interactive_session.py
```
> **You**: "Scan the network for open ports."
> **JARVIS**: "Initiating Advanced Network Scan..."

### 2. Automated Scenarios
Run targeted playbooks.

```powershell
.\run_framework.ps1 --scenario adv_threat_hunt
```
